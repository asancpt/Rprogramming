## Regression

Finally, let's run a regression analysis to see if a pirate's age, weight, and number of tattoos (s)he has predicts how many treasure chests he/she's found:

```{r}
# Create a linear regression model: DV = tchests, IV = age, weight, tattoos
tchests.model <- lm(formula = tchests ~ age + weight + tattoos,
                    data = aht_trial2)

# Show summary statistics
summary(tchests.model)
```

It looks like the only significant predictor of the number of treasure chests that a pirate has found is his/her age. There does not seem to be significant effect of weight or tattoos.

## Bayesian Statistics

Now, let's repeat some of our previous analyses with Bayesian versions. First we'll install and load the \texttt{BayesFactor} package which contains the Bayesian statistics functions we'll use:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install and load the BayesFactor package
install.packages('BayesFactor')
library(BayesFactor)
```

Now that the packages is installed and loaded, we're good to go! Let's do a Bayesian version of our earlier t-test asking if aht_trial2 who wear a headband are older or younger than those who do not.

```{r}
# Bayesian t-test comparing the age of aht_trial2 with and without headbands
ttestBF(formula = age ~ headband,
        data = aht_trial2)
```

It looks like we got a Bayes factor of 0.12 which is strong evidence *for* the null hypothesis (that the mean age does not differ between aht_trial2 with and without headbands)


## Wasn't that easy?!

Wait...wait...WAIT! Did you seriously just calculate descriptive statistics, a t-test, an ANOVA, and a regression, create a scatterplot and a pirateplot, AND do both a Bayesian t-test and regression analysis. Yup. Imagine how long it would have taken to explain how to do all that in SPSS. And while you haven't really learned how R works yet, I'd bet my beard that you could easily alter the previous code to do lots of other analyses. Of course, don't worry if some or all of the previous code didn't make sense. Soon...it will all be clear.

Now that you've jumped in, let's learn how to swim.
